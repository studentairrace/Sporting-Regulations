{\bf What are the Sporting Regulations?} \\ \\
Welcome to the Sporting Regulations for the Student AirRace. This document outlines the rules and guidelines that govern the competition, with the goal of ensuring that all teams have a fair and safe experience. These regulations are separate from the Technical Regulations, which detail the specific requirements and standards for the design and construction of the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that will compete in the event.
\\ \\
The Sporting Regulations provide information on various aspects of the competition, such as the schedule of events, the scoring system, and the roles and responsibilities of the teams and organizers. Additionally, they describe the procedures for scrutineering, briefings, protests, and other important activities that occur before, during, and after the competition.
\\ \\
It is important that all teams carefully read and understand both the Sporting Regulations and Technical Regulations in order to ensure that their UAVs meet the necessary requirements and that they are fully prepared for the competition. Any questions or concerns regarding these regulations can be directed to the organizers for clarification.
\\ \\
If you were looking for the technical regulations governing the construction and specifications of the participating UAVs, they can be found on our website at www.student-airrace.com/competition. These regulations should be read in conjunction with the sporting regulations provided in this document.

      \item If two teams achieve the same amount of points, also known as a dead heat after all points have been awarded, the winner will be declared who scored more points in the efficiency discipline. 
      If both have also equally scored in this discipline, this process repeats for the safety, design maturity and, innovation \& sustainability disciplines in the hereby mentioned order. If this doesn't deliver any result, the organiser will make a decision. 
      \item The following table shows how the total points are distributed across the individual disciplines. 

      \begin{center}
        \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} 
          \hline
          Discipline & Points & Awardment Process \\

        \end{tabular}
      \end{center}
    \end{enumerate}

    \subsection{Comparability between runs}
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item To ensure comparability between the runs, the organisers will limit the metrological conditions during which the runs can happen. If the organiser calls the conditions fine for takeoff, the takeoff time window rule applies. \\
      The organisers will monitor the following conditions at the track during the flights:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Precipitation
        \item Temperature 
        \item Windspeed
        \item Humidity
        \item Air Pressure
        \item GNSS Connectivity and satellite number at a fixed position on site (GPS only) 
        \item Frequency jamming
      \end{itemize}
    \end{enumerate}

    \subsection{Race Course Layouts}
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item The Race course layout will be built within a rectangular zone. This rectangle has side lengths of 1500m and 500m. The maximum height during the flight is limited to 100m Above Ground (AGL).
      \item No point within the race course layout will be further away than 1000m from the Ground Station. Also, every point of the racecourse layout will be able to be flown within the Line Of Sight of the Ground Station. 
      \item Race courses consist of an assembly of different predetermined race course elements published with the regulations.
      \item The official assembly of race course layouts for the three hot lap sessions will not be published until shortly before the competition to prevent the teams from overfitting their aircraft to one specific racecourse. 
      \item Race course assembly kits are published in Annex A. 
      \item The race courses are marked with the help of 12m high pylons or flags. 
    \end{enumerate}


    \section{Flight Operations at the final competition}
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item During the flights, the teams must assign different roles within the Team at the track, defined in the latter regulations.
      \item Each person fulfilling a role must communicate fluently to the organisers in English.
      \item A minimum of four (4) persons are required at the track to be allowed to conduct the flights.
      \item A maximum of ten (10) persons by a team are allowed at the track. For clarification: This does not affect the number of persons each Team is allowed to have in the paddock. 
      \item 
    \end{enumerate}

    \subsection{Required roles during flight}
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item \textbf{PL: Pilot}\\The pilot is responsible for flying the UAV.
      \item \textbf{AO: Airspace Observer/Spotter}\\The AO stands next to the PL and has an unobstructed view of the airspace around the drone. They talk to the PL directly in person. The PL and AO can communicate via an intercom if they stay beside each other. 
      \item \textbf{FE: Safety Engineer}\\The safety engineer is the one who was responsible for the safety report. Their task is to constantly monitor the situation and warn the others if they are getting into any problematic situations. 
      \item \textbf{FOL: Flight Operations Lead}\\The FOL makes the tactical decisions during the flight. They request Takeoff Permission from CL (Competition Lead). They manage contingency and emergency procedures. They are essentially the boss of the Team's operation.
    \end{enumerate}


    \subsection{Requirements for the pilots}\label{SubSec:PilotRequirements}
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Each team must have at least three different designated pilots. The names of those pilots must be sent to the organizer at least 
      30 days before the competition. 
      \item Each pilot must have flown and documented at least twenty (20) hours on comparable UAVs (e.g. Racing Quadrocopters) in the past 12 months.  
      \item The pilots must be able to fluently communicate with the organizers in English, in order to be able to follow safety relevant commands during flight.
      \item The pilots may have have to perform a flight test check in front of the organizers at the competition. This is just a quick test flight with any multicopter UAS to demonstrate the pilots basic flight skills.
    \end{enumerate}




    \section{Disciplines}
    \subsection{Thrust Test Stand}
    \textbf{Disciple Outline}
    The thrust test stand is a crucial part of the Scrutineering process and ensures that teams meet all the requirements outlined in the technical regulations. It also serves as a means for organisers to assess the safety and reliability of the teams' vehicles and their technical condition. This discipline requires successful performance to qualify for takeoff clearance for the Hotlap races.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Each Team must demonstrate their vehicle's performance on the thrust test stand.
      \item Each Team will be assigned a specific time for their vehicle to be tested and must be ready at that time.
      \item The vehicle must be mounted on the thrust test stand using the adapter specified in the technical regulations.
      \item The Team must run their vehicle for at least 50\% of their battery capacity on the thrust test stand.
      \item The shape of the used thrust curve over time is at the discretion of the competitors.
      \item The team must complete the thrust test stand event within 15 minutes. Failing to do so or not utilizing at least 50\% of the battery capacity will result in a penalty.
      \item The Thrust to Weight Ratio (TWR) of the vehicle, calculated from its weight during scrutineering, must be at least 2:1. The minimum Thrust measured on the vehicle Thrust Test Stand must exceed the required value to achieve this ratio for at least 5 seconds under standard atmospheric conditions.
      \item If the atmospheric conditions during testing do not meet the ICAO standard atmosphere conditions, a correction factor based on the current air density will be applied to the thrust stand results linearly.
      \item The teams are responsible for securing their aircraft on the thrust test stand.
    \end{itemize}



    \subsection{Hotlap races}
    \textbf{Disciple Outline}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item There will be a total of three (3) hotlap races on different tracks during the competition. The following rules apply to a single race.
      \item Each team will be given a fivteen (15) minute time window during which they can conduct their flights. 
      \item Each team is only allowed to set a maximum of five timed (5) laps during their time window. 
      \item Each laptime will be logged by the organizer. It counts as the time from which the aircraft passes the start/timing line until the aircraft has crossed the timing/finish line. 
      \item The points will be awarded in order of fastest hotlap achieved by each of the teams during their time window.
    \end{itemize}

    \subsubsection{Hotlap Race Rules}
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item The following rules apply in combination with the later specified Race Procedures.
      \item The lap time will be recorded according to the Hotlap Race Procedures outlined in the following Race Procedure sections.
      \item Teams are required to pass through every gate on the course. Missing a gate will result in the lap time being invalidated.
      \item If a gate is defined as a pole, teams must pass the pole on the side specified by the organizers. Failing to do so will result in the lap time being invalidated.
      \item Teams must ensure their drones remain within the flight perimeter, or geocage, at all times. Any drone found to be flying outside the geocage may be disqualified or face penalties.
      \item Each hyperdrone will be able to fly their hotlap individually, with no other drones operating simultaneously. This is to ensure safety and avoid interference during the race.
      \item The start gate can be crossed at any velocity. Teams are allowed to have a run-up, provided it does not exceed the boundaries of the location.
      \item A lap can be aborted at any time at the team's discretion. If a lap is aborted, the time will be reset and will start again once the team's drone crosses the start gate for a new lap.
      \item Each team is allowed to pass through the start gate for a total of five times. However, they may conduct practice laps without crossing the start gate.  
      \item The points will be awarded in order of fastest hotlap achieved by each of the teams during their time window. Only the fastest lap of the competitor will be counted. Even if their second fastest lap should be faster than the one of another compeitor.
      \item If two or more competitors achieve the exact same finish time, their points will be added together and divided equally across the them.  
      \item Teams are expected to follow all additional rules and guidelines provided by the organizers. Dangerous flying will immediately result in disqualification. 
      \item During the hotlap time window no one is allowed to touch the UAV withot prior authorization by the organizers. If any member of the competing team touches the drone, it will result in immediate disqualification.
    \end{enumerate}


    \subsubsection{Hotlap Race Procedures}
    \textbf{Start of a Hotlap Race}
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Each team gets a certain time slot during which they are allowed to conduct their hotlaps. 
      \item The organizer will ensure that the time is only started if a set of weather conditions is met. Afterwards there is no going back. This is comparable to the process ski jumpers undergo during their competitions.
      \item The start of the session is called by the organizer. Afterfwards the clock is started and a fivteen (15) minute timer begins to tick down. The teams must conduct their hot laps within this time frame.
      \item The teams are free to conduct flights however they'd like to during this time as long as all other rules are adhered to. This is up to their strategy. One team may fly three slow training laps and one racelap. Another team may set three race times or wait on the ground for exactly the right wind conditions.
    \end{enumerate}
    \textbf{Suspension of a Hotlap Race}
    \begin{enumerate}[resume]
      \item The session can be suspended by the organizer in case of unexpected events such as uninvolved people or aircraft entering the flight test area. A sudden change of weather which exceeds the limits set by the organizer may also lead to a suspesion of the session. 
      \item In case of a suspension the clock will be stopped. 
      \item The pilot must abort the lap immediately and slow the UAS down. Further actions will be coordinated together with the organizers depending on the situation.
      \item The pilot must stay away as far as possible from uninvolved people as possible at any point in time. 
    \end{enumerate}

    \textbf{Resumption after suspension of a Hotlap Race}
    \begin{enumerate}[resume]
      \item The clock is started from where it was stopped beforehand.
      \item Depending on the situation, the organisers may add time to the clock to compensate for the time lost due to the suspension. 
    \end{enumerate}

    \textbf{Finish of a Hotlap Race}
    \begin{enumerate}[resume]
      \item The finish of a session is called after the fifteen (15) minute time window is over. After this, the teams are not allowed to start a new lap.
      \item Teams may finish the current lap in progress if it does not take longer than two minutes.
      \item Teams may prematurely communicate their wish to end the current Hotlaprace to the organiser. For example, if there's still time left but the battery charge is insufficient to conduct another safe lap.
      \item In case of a ground collision from which the Team cannot safely recover, the session is also ended. 
      \item The organiser may call an early end for a session if they deem a continuation of the flight as unsafe. The session will not be retaken.  
      \item If the Team doesn't manage to land at the landing pad, even though a safe landing is possible after the end of the race, a penalty is applied by the organisers.
    \end{enumerate}

 

    \subsection{Autonomous Races}
    \textbf{Disciple Outline: }The autonomous races will test the ability of the teams to develop and implement autonomous control algorithms for their drones. These races will be held on a separate track and will have their own set of rules. THIS DISCIPLINE IS NOT MANDATORY.
 
    
    \begin{itemize}
      \item There will be a total of three (3) autonomous hotlap races on different tracks during the competition. The following rules apply to a single race.
      \item Each team will be given a fivteen (15) minute time window during which they can conduct their flights. 
      \item Each team is only allowed to set a maximum of five timed (5) laps during their time window. 
      \item Each laptime will be logged by the organizer. It counts as the time from which the aircraft passes the start/timing line until the aircraft has crossed the timing/finish line. 
      \item The points will be awarded in order of fastest autonomous hotlap achieved by each of the teams during their time window.
    \end{itemize}


    \subsubsection{Autnomous Race Rules}
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item The following rules apply in combination with the later specified Autnomous Race Procedures.
    \item Each team must design and program their own autonomous control algorithms for their drones.
    \item Teams may choose to build a new second hyperdrone specifically for the autonomous races, as long as it meets all the technical regulations outlined in the technical regulations.
    \item Alternatively, teams may use the same hyperdrone for both the manual and autonomous disciplines.
    \item All calculations for autonomous control algorithms must be run onboard the drone and cannot be executed from a ground station or other external computing device.
    \item The drone may communicate with external devices to receive location data or other necessary information, but all control and decision-making processes must be performed onboard the drone.
    \item Each lap must be completed autonomously by the drone without a single intervention by a human. Otherwise, the lap will be invalidated.
    \item The drones must pass through every gate on the course. Missing a gate will result in a time penalty.
    \item If a gate is defined as a pole, drones must pass the pole on the side specified by the organisers. Failing to do so will result in a time penalty.
    \item Drones must remain within the flight perimeter, or geo cage, at all times. Any drone found to be flying outside the geo cage may be disqualified or face penalties.
    \item The start gate can be crossed at any velocity. Teams are allowed to have a run-up, provided it does not exceed the boundaries of the location.
    \item The points will be awarded in order of the fastest lap each Team achieves during the race.
    \item If two or more competitors achieve the same finish time, their points will be added together and divided equally.
    \item Teams are expected to follow all additional rules and guidelines provided by the organisers. Dangerous flying without clear intent to fly the laps properly will immediately result in disqualification.
    \end{enumerate}

    \subsubsection{Manual Control, Safety Functions, and Autonomous Flight}
    \begin{enumerate}[resume]
    \item The hyperdrone used in the autonomous race must be capable of both manual control and autonomous flight.
    \item All drones used in the autonomous races must also be able to be manually controlled by the team and always manually overwritable.
    \item A safety pilot must be in place to take over the drone by manual control.
    \item The drone must have the capability of triggering safety functions such as kill switches and Return to Home (RTH) capabilities.
    \item The team must be able to trigger these safety functions at any time during the race if necessary.
    \item The drone must be presented to the scrutineering committee prior to the start of the autonomous race to ensure that it meets all manual control, safety function, autonomous flight requirements and the technical regulations.
    \item The team may use manual flight to move the drone to the designated starting position or landing spot before the race begins, or to interfere with the drone during the race if necessary for safety reasons or to abort/restart a lap.
    \item Once the race begins at the start gate, the drone must autonomously fly the course without any further manual flight input.
    \item Any manual flight input between the start gate and finish gate that affects the drone's flight path or speed will result in an invalid lap time.
    \item The Team may be allowed to retake the lap if the manual flight input was due to safety reasons and was not the Team's fault.
    \item Violating the rules regarding manual control, safety functions, and autonomous flight may result in disqualification.
    \end{enumerate}





    \subsubsection{Race Procedures}
    \textbf{Start of the Autonomous Race}
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Each team will be given a fivteen (15) minute time window during which they can conduct their flights. 
    \item The organizer will ensure that the time window can only start if a set of weather conditions is met. Once the race starts, there is no going back.
    \item The teams are free to program their drones/choose control algorithms however they like. This is up to their strategy. 
    \end{enumerate}

    \textbf{Suspension of the Autonomous Race}
    \begin{enumerate}[resume]
    \item The organiser can suspend the race in case of unexpected events, such as uninvolved people or aircraft entering the flight test area. A sudden change of weather which exceeds the limits set by the organiser may also lead to a suspension of the race.
    \item In case of a suspension, the drones must immediately stop racing, change to manual control and return to the start gate or follow instructions by the organiser.
    \item The pilot must stay away as far as possible from uninvolved people as possible at any point in time.
    \ Further action will be discussed with the organisers depending on the situation.
    \end{enumerate}

    \textbf{Resumption after Suspension of the Autonomous Race}
    \begin{enumerate}[resume]
    \item The race will resume once the suspension is lifted.
    \item Depending on the situation, the organisers may add additional time to the race or allow the competitors to recharge their batteries to a certain level to compensate for the suspension.
    \end{enumerate}
