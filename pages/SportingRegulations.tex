{\bf What are the Sporting Regulations?} \\ \\
Welcome to the Sporting Regulations for the Student AirRace. This document outlines the rules and guidelines that govern the competition, with the goal of ensuring that all teams have a fair and safe experience. These regulations are separate from the Technical Regulations, which detail the specific requirements and standards for the design and construction of the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that will compete in the event.
\\ \\
The Sporting Regulations provide information on various aspects of the competition, such as the schedule of events, the scoring system, and the roles and responsibilities of the teams and organizers. Additionally, they describe the procedures for scrutineering, briefings, protests, and other important activities that occur before, during, and after the competition.
\\ \\
It is important that all teams carefully read and understand both the Sporting Regulations and Technical Regulations in order to ensure that their UAVs meet the necessary requirements and that they are fully prepared for the competition. Any questions or concerns regarding these regulations can be directed to the organizers for clarification.
\\ \\
If you were looking for the technical regulations governing the construction and specifications of the participating UAVs, they can be found on our website at www.student-airrace.com/competition. These regulations should be read in conjunction with the sporting regulations provided in this document.

      If both of them have also equally scored equally in this discipline this process repeats for the Technical Report, design maturity and innovation \& sustainability disciplines in the hereby mentioned order. If this doesn't deliver any result the organizer will make a decision. 
      \item The following table shows how the total points are distributed across the individual disciplines. 

      \begin{center}
        \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} 
          \hline

    \end{enumerate}

    \subsection{Comparability between runs}
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item To ensure comparability between the runs, the organizers are going to set limits on the metrological conditions during which the runs can happen. If the organizer is calling the conditions to be fine for takeoff the takeoff time window rule applies. \\
      The organizers will monitor the following conditions at the track during the flights:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Precipitation
        \item Temperature 
        \item Windspeed
        \item Humidity
        \item Air Pressure
        \item GNSS Connectivity and satellite number at fixed position on site (GPS only) 
        \item Frequency jamming
      \end{itemize}
    \end{enumerate}

    \subsection{Race Course Layouts}
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item The Race course layout will be build within a rectengular shaped zone. This rectangle has sidelengths of 1500m and 500m. The maximum height during the flight is limited to 100m Above Ground (AGL).
      \item No point within the race course layout is going to be further away than 1000m from the Ground Station. Also every point of the racecourse layout will be able to be flown within Line Of Sight of the Ground Station. 
      \item Race courses consist of an assembly of different predetermined race course elements which are published with the regulations.
      \item The official assembly of race course layouts for the three hotlap sessions will not be published until shortly before the competition, in order to prevent the teams from overfitting their aircraft to one specificn racecourse. 
      \item The race courses are marked with the help of 6m or 12m high pylons or flags.
      \item Each of the gates the teams have to fly through consitsts of two pylons which stand \textcolor{red}{12m} apart (subject to change with feedback by the teams).
      \item In some occasions a single pylon may indicate a 180° turn around the pylon or a slalom parcour where each pylone must be passed from a different side. 
      \item Each gate is at least 50m apart from the previous gate. The minimum turnradius (for non 180° degree turns is always at least 50m).
    \end{enumerate}

    \section{Flight Operations at the Final Competition}
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item During the flights, the teams must assign different roles within the team at the track, which are defined in the latter regulations.
      \item Each person which fullfills a required role must be able to fluently communicate to the organizers in english.
      \item A minimum of four (4) persons are required at the track to be allowed to conduct the flights.
      \item A maximum of ten (10) persons by a team are allowed at the track. For clarification: This does not affect the amount of persons each team is allowed to have in the paddock.  
      \item The teams will be provided with a Ground Control Station at the location described within the Race Course Layout chapter. This Ground Control Station can be set up by the team however they please. It includes two 3mx3m tents which are open towards the front. Two tables and up to 6 seats. Those are the positions where the UAV should be operatored from.
    \end{enumerate}

    \subsection{Required Roles During Flight}
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item \textbf{PL: Pilot}\\The pilot is the person responsible for flying the UAV.
      \item \textbf{AO: Airspace Observer/Spotter}\\The AO stands next to the PL and has an unobstructed view of the airspace around the drone. They talk to the PL directly in person. The PL and AO are allowed to communicate via intercom if they stay right next to each other. 
      \item \textbf{FE: Safety Engineer}\\The safety engineer is the one who was responsible for the safety report. Their task is to constantly monitor the situation and warn the others if they are getting into any problematic situations. 
      \item \textbf{FOL: Flight Operations Lead}\\The FOL makes the tactical decisions during the flight. They request for Takeoff Permission from CL (Competition Lead). They manage contingency and emergency procedures. They are essentially the boss of the teams operation.
      \item All of the roles and the names of the responsible team members, as well as backup per position will need to be entered to the organizer 30 days prior to the competition. 
    \end{enumerate}


    \subsection{Requirements for the Pilots}\label{pilotrequirements}
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Each team must have at least three different designated pilots. The names of those pilots must be sent to the organizer at least 
      14 days before the competition. 
      \item Each pilot must have flown and documented at least twenty (20) hours on comparable UAVs (e.g. Racing Quadrocopters) in the past 12 months. 
      \item Up to 75 \% of those hours may be flown in simulators.
      \item The pilots must be able to fluently communicate with the organizers in English, in order to be able to follow safety relevant commands during flight.
      \item The pilots may have have to perform a flight test check in front of the organizers at the competition. This is just a quick test flight with any multicopter UAS to demonstrate the pilots basic flight skills.
    \end{enumerate}




    \section{Disciplines}
    \subsection{Thrust Test Stand}
    \textbf{Disciple Outline}
    The thrust test stand is a crucial part of the Scrutineering process and ensures that teams meet all the necessary requirements outlined in the technical regulations. It also serves as a means for organizers to assess the safety and reliability of the teams' vehicles and their technical condition. A successful performance in this discipline is required to qualify for takeoff clearance for the Hotlap races.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Each team must demonstrate their vehicle's performance on the thrust test stand.
      \item Each team will be assigned a specific time for their vehicle to be tested and must be ready at that time.
      \item The vehicle must be mounted on the thrust test stand using the adapter specified in the technical regulations.
      \item The shape of the used thrust curve over time is at the discretion of the competitors. The organizer may however demand certain thrust inputs for certain amount of times (for example 80 \% throttle for 10 seconds), which must then be followed by the competitor.
      \item The Thrust to Weight Ratio (TWR) of the vehicle, calculated from its weight during scrutineering, must be at least 2:1. The minimum Thrust measured on the vehicle Thrust Test Stand must exceed the required value to achieve this ratio for at least 5 seconds under standard atmospheric conditions.
      \item If the atmospheric conditions during testing do not meet the ICAO standard atmosphere conditions, a correction factor based on the current air density will be applied to the thrust stand results linearly.
      \item The teams are responsible for securing their aircraft on the thrust test stand.
      \end{itemize}



    \subsection{Hotlap Races}
    \textbf{Disciple Outline}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item There will be a total of three (3) hotlap races on different tracks during the competition. The following rules apply to a single race.
      \item Each team will be given a fivteen (15) minute time window during which they can conduct their flights. 
      \item Each team is only allowed to set a maximum of five timed (5) laps during their time window. 
      \item Each laptime will be logged by the organizer. It counts as the time from which the aircraft passes the start/timing line until the aircraft has crossed the timing/finish line. 
      \item The points will be awarded in order of fastest hotlap achieved by each of the teams during their time window.
    \end{itemize}

    \subsubsection{Hotlap Race Rules}
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item The following rules apply in combination with the later specified Race Procedures.
      \item The lap time will be recorded according to the Hotlap Race Procedures outlined in the following Race Procedure sections.
      \item Teams are required to pass through every gate on the course. Missing a gate will result in the lap time being invalidated.
      \item If a gate is defined as a pole, teams must pass the pole on the side specified by the organizers. Failing to do so will result in the lap time being invalidated.
      \item Teams must ensure their drones remain within the flight perimeter, or geocage, at all times. Any drone found to be flying outside the geocage may be disqualified or face penalties.
      \item Each hyperdrone will be able to fly their hotlap individually, with no other drones operating simultaneously. This is to ensure safety and avoid interference during the race.
      \item The start gate can be crossed at any velocity. Teams are allowed to have a run-up, provided it does not exceed the boundaries of the location.
      \item A lap can be aborted at any time at the team's discretion. If a lap is aborted, the time will be reset and will start again once the team's drone crosses the start gate for a new lap.
      \item Each team is allowed to pass through the start gate for a total of five times. However, they may conduct practice laps without crossing the start gate.  
      \item The points will be awarded in order of fastest hotlap achieved by each of the teams during their time window. Only the fastest lap of the competitor will be counted. Even if their second fastest lap should be faster than the one of another compeitor.
      \item If two or more competitors achieve the exact same finish time, their points will be added together and divided equally across the them.  
      \item Teams are expected to follow all additional rules and guidelines provided by the organizers. Dangerous flying will immediately result in disqualification. 
      \item During the hotlap time window no one is allowed to touch the UAV withot prior authorization by the organizers. If any member of the competing team touches the drone, it will result in immediate disqualification.
    \end{enumerate}


    \subsubsection{Hotlap Race Procedures}
    \textbf{Start of a Hotlap Race}
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Each team gets a certain time slot during which they are allowed to conduct their hotlaps. 
      \item The organizer will ensure that the time is only started if a set of weather conditions is met. Afterwards there is no going back. This is comparable to the process ski jumpers undergo during their competitions.
      \item The start of the session is called by the organizer. Afterfwards the clock is started and a fivteen (15) minute timer begins to tick down. The teams must conduct their hot laps within this time frame.
      \item The teams are free to conduct flights however they'd like to during this time as long as all other rules are adhered to. This is up to their strategy. One team may fly three slow training laps and one racelap. Another team may set three race times or wait on the ground for exactly the right wind conditions.
    \end{enumerate}
    \textbf{Suspension of a Hotlap Race}
    \begin{enumerate}[resume]
      \item The session can be suspended by the organizer in case of unexpected events such as uninvolved people or aircraft entering the flight test area. A sudden change of weather which exceeds the limits set by the organizer may also lead to a suspesion of the session. 
      \item In case of a suspension the clock will be stopped. 
      \item The pilot must abort the lap immediately and slow the UAS down. Further actions will be coordinated together with the organizers depending on the situation.
      \item The pilot must stay away as far as possible from uninvolved people as possible at any point in time. 
    \end{enumerate}

    \textbf{Resumption after suspension of a Hotlap Race}
    \begin{enumerate}[resume]
      \item The clock is started from where it was stopped beforehand.
      \item Depending on the situation the organizers may add additional time to the clock, and/or allow the competitior to charge their battery to a certain level in order to compensate for the suspension.
    \end{enumerate}

    \textbf{Finish of a Hotlap Race}
    \begin{enumerate}[resume]
      \item The finish of a session is called after the fivteen (15) minute time window is over. After this the teams are not allowed to start a new lap.
      \item Teams may finish the current lap in progess if it does not take longer than two minutes.
      \item Teams may communicate their wish to prematurely end the current Hotlaprace to the organizer. For example if there's still time left but the battery charge is not enough to conduct another safe lap.
      \item In case of a ground colission from which the team is not able to safely recover the session is also ended. 
      \item The organizer may call an early end for a session if they deem a contiuation of the flight as unsafe. The session will not be retaken.  
      \item If the team doesn't manage to land at the landing pad, even though a safe landing is possible after the end of the race a penatly is applied by the organizers.
    \end{enumerate}

 

    \subsection{Autonomous Races}
    \textbf{Disciple Outline: }The autonomous races will test the ability of the teams to develop and implement autonomous control algorithms for their drones. These races will be held on a separate track and will have their own set of rules. THIS DISCIPLINE IS NOT MANDATORY.
 
    
    \begin{itemize}
      \item There will be a total of three (3) autonomous hotlap races on different tracks during the competition. The following rules apply to a single race.
      \item Each team will be given a fivteen (15) minute time window during which they can conduct their flights. 
      \item Each team is only allowed to set a maximum of five timed (5) laps during their time window. 
      \item Each laptime will be logged by the organizer. It counts as the time from which the aircraft passes the start/timing line until the aircraft has crossed the timing/finish line. 
      \item The points will be awarded in order of fastest autonomous hotlap achieved by each of the teams during their time window.
    \end{itemize}


    \subsubsection{Autnomous Race Rules}
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item The following rules apply in combination with the later specified Autnomous Race Procedures.
    \item Each team must design and program their own autonomous control algorithms for their drones.
    \item Teams may choose to build a new second hyperdrone specifically for the autonomous races, as long as it meets all the technical regulations outlined in the technical regulations.
    \item Alternatively, teams may use the same hyperdrone for both the manual and autonomous disciplines.
    \item All calculations for autonomous control algorithms must be run onboard the drone and cannot be executed from a ground station or other external computing device.
    \item The drone may communicate with external devices for the purpose of receiving location data or other necessary information, but all control and decision-making processes must be performed onboard the drone.
    \item Each lap must be completed autonomously by the drone without a single intervention by a human. Otherwise the lap will be invalidated.
    \item The drones must pass through every gate on the course. Missing a gate will result in a time penalty.
    \item If a gate is defined as a pole, drones must pass the pole on the side specified by the organizers. Failing to do so will result in a time penalty.
    \item Drones must remain within the flight perimeter, or geocage, at all times. Any drone found to be flying outside the geocage may be disqualified or face penalties.
    \item The start gate can be crossed at any velocity. Teams are allowed to have a run-up, provided it does not exceed the boundaries of the location.
    \item The points will be awarded in order of fastest lap achieved by each of the teams during the race.
    \item If two or more competitors achieve the exact same finish time, their points will be added together and divided equally across them.
    \item Teams are expected to follow all additional rules and guidelines provided by the organizers. Dangerous flying are having no clear intend to properly fly the laps will immediately result in disqualification.
    \end{enumerate}

    \subsubsection{Manual Control, Safety Functions, and Autonomous Flight}
    \begin{enumerate}[resume]
    \item The hyperdrone used in the autonomous race must be capable of both manual control and autonomous flight.
    \item All drones used in the autonomous races must also be able to be manually controlled by the team and always manually overwritable.
    \item A safety pilot must be in place to take over the drone by manual control.
    \item The drone must have the capability of triggering safety functions such as kill switches and Return to Home (RTH) capabilities.
    \item The team must be able to trigger these safety functions at any time during the race if necessary.
    \item The drone must be presented to the scrutineering committee prior to the start of the autonomous race to ensure that it meets all manual control, safety function, autonomous flight requirements and the technical regulations.
    \item The team may use manual flight to move the drone to the designated starting position or landing spot before the race begins, or to interfere with the drone during the race if necessary for safety reasons or to abort/restart a lap.
    \item Once the race begins at the start gate, the drone must autonomously fly the course without any further manual flight input.
    \item Any manual flight input between the start gate and finish gate that affects the drone's flight path or speed will result in an invalid lap time.
    \item The team may be allowed to retake the lap if the manual flight input was due to safety reasons and was not the fault of the team.
    \item Violation of the rules regarding manual control, safety functions, and autonomous flight may result in disqualification.
    \end{enumerate}





    \subsubsection{Race Procedures}
    \textbf{Start of the Autonomous Race}
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Each team will be given a fivteen (15) minute time window during which they can conduct their flights. 
    \item The organizer will ensure that the time window can only start if a set of weather conditions is met. Once the race starts, there is no going back.
    \item The teams are free to program their drones/choose control algorithms however they like. This is up to their strategy. 
    \end{enumerate}

    \textbf{Suspension of the Autonomous Race}
    \begin{enumerate}[resume]
    \item The race can be suspended by the organizer in case of unexpected events such as uninvolved people or aircraft entering the flight test area. A sudden change of weather which exceeds the limits set by the organizer may also lead to a suspension of the race.
    \item In case of a suspension, the drones must immediately stop racing, be changed to manual control and return to the start gate or follow instructions by the organizer.
    \item The safety pilot must ensure that the UAV stays away as far as possible from uninvolved people as possible at any point in time.
    \item Further actions will be coordinated together with the organizers depending on the situation.
    \end{enumerate}

    \textbf{Resumption after Suspension of the Autonomous Race}
    \begin{enumerate}[resume]
    \item The race will resume once the suspension is lifted.
    \item Depending on the situation, the organizers may add additional time to the race, and/or allow the competitors to recharge their batteries to a certain level in order to compensate for the suspension.
    \end{enumerate}
